# PhoneDirectorySystem
A simplistic phone directory, similar to yellow pages.

This web-app was done to learn about the various web development technologies used in practice today.
The phone directory supports the fundamental data manipulation functions: Create, Read, Update, Delete(C.R.U.D), which
can be used by interacting with the buttons on the UI.

Note: The rest-service resides in PhoneDirectorySystem/, and the UI resides in webPhoneDirectorySystem/.
